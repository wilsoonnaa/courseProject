                                <p>Obbe Vermeij, a former developer at Rockstar who worked on several games in the franchise, said that the company always wanted to add a multiplayer mode to the series, and he even got a basic deathmatch going for GTA 3. However, the studio never found the time to do it properly, so the game was left without the feature. Vermeij shared this little fact under his post explaining how cars appear and disappear in GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas to give the appearance of a busy city. His code places vehicles 70m in front of the player and removes them 90m ahead. Those out of the player&#039;s line of sight spawn 15m away and vanish at 25m.</p>
